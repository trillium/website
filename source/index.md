The principal consultant at Trillium, Emma Jane Hogbin Westby, is a transplant from Ontario, Canada and brought the mark of the flower with her. She has been active in software development since the mid-90s; and has been working with teams of open source developers for over a decade. She has a strong background in Drupal software development, and has written two books on the topic (<cite>Front End Drupal</cite>; and <cite>Drupal User's Guide</cite>). Her latest book, <cite>Git for Teams</cite>, broadens her scope to any software development team using the distributed version control system, Git.

She is a sought-after technical project manager and has received certifications in team building and management. Through her own business, and via client contracts she has delivered training around the globe. She has been leading product development teams for several years; most recently for the United Nations.

Emma is available as a technical project manager, scrum master, or team consultant. She is also available for select training opportunities relating to Git, or Drupal.
